# AlgoFlow 
## Hack WashU 2024 project

### Description:
Have you ever had an idea about the market but did not have the time or expertise to implement it? AlgoFlow is a full stack app that serves as an online trading platform for users to find, develop, and deploy machine learning models across prediction markets. Whether you are just starting out in machine learning or a seasoned veteran, our streamless and codeless design allows you to take advantage of our models to discover your new trading edge. Leveraging a React Flow front end, we visualize beautiful and simple data streams that are not only understandable, but conveys the essential size and flow of the data. Our own proprietary trading models developed by our very own data science team enable anything from simple linear discovery to a mixture of LSTM and GRU recurrent neural networks. The landing dashboard, with integrations to the market and your own order book, provides information about your profit & loss, risk metrics, and market conditions at your fingertips. Future directions plan to have an internal automated trading system to extend the train/test workflow to full deployment and internal links to your various wallets, making algorithmic trading truly available to anyone.
